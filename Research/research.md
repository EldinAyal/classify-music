# **Related Projects:**
* Deep models AND traditional using features(these two projects resembles ours alot and i want us to learn the basic structure of the model from them ,both also use **GAZAN** dataset
    * [Music genre by Haris](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01149)
    this project uses two appearches: a deep model one (CNN) and a model with features.
    things to watch out for mainly: the dataset and "mathmatical" features.

    * [Music genre by Ahmit](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8554016)
    this project like the last project uses a deep model then a model with features , it also incoporates decesion trees
    
    * [Pure Decesion trees](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Beatriz-Flamia-Azevedo/publication/321023135_A_Decision_Tree_Approach_for_the_Musical_Genres_Classification/links/604bf768299bf13c4f01183d/A-Decision-Tree-Approach-for-the-Musical-Genres-Classification.pdf) pure decesion tree
      approach, has tons of features (also mathimatical-spectrum features)
